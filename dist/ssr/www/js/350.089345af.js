Conceived by Ed Hutchins, play was on pegboards using miniature plastic ships. In 1977, Milton Bradley also released a computerized Electronic Battleship.[4] Electronic Battleship was designed by Dennis Wyman and Bing McCoy and reputed to be the first toy with a sound chip. It was followed in 1989 by Electronic Talking Battleship.[5] In 2008, an updated version of Battleship was released, using hexagonal tiles. In the updated version, each player's board contains several islands on which \"captured man\" figurines can be placed. Ships may be placed only around the islands, and only in the player's half of the board. When the movie Battleship was released, the board game reverted to the original 1967 style.
