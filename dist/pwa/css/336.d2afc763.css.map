I. Horsman's 1890 game Basilinda, and the game is\r\n              said to have been played by Russian officers before World War I. <br>\r\n              The first commercial version of the game was Salvo, published in 1931 in the United States by the\r\n              Starex company. <br>\r\n              Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's\r\n              Combat: The Battleship Game, Milton Bradley's Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy and Maurice L.\r\n              Freedman's Warfare Naval Combat. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called Wings which pictured\r\n              planes flying over the Los Angeles Coliseum. All of these early editions of the game consisted of\r\n              pre-printed pads of paper.[2]\r\n\r\n              <br><br>\r\n              Players in a Battleship tournament aboard a U.S. Navy vessel\r\n              In 1967 Milton Bradley introduced a version of the game that used plastic boards and pegs. Conceived\r\n              by Ed Hutchins, play was on pegboards using miniature plastic ships. In 1977, Milton Bradley also\r\n              released a computerized Electronic Battleship.[4] Electronic Battleship was designed by Dennis Wyman\r\n              and Bing McCoy and reputed to be the first toy with a sound chip. It was followed in 1989 by\r\n              Electronic Talking Battleship.[5] In 2008, an updated version of Battleship was released, using\r\n              hexagonal tiles. In the updated version, each player's board contains several islands on which\r\n              \"captured man\" figurines can be placed. Ships may be placed only around the islands, and only in the\r\n              player's half of the board. When the movie Battleship was released, the board game reverted to the\r\n              original 1967 style. The 2008 updated version is still available as Battleship Islands.\r\n              <br><br>\r\n              Battleship was one of the earliest games to be produced as a computer game, with a version being\r\n              released for the Z80 Compucolor in 1979. Many computer editions of the game have been produced since.\r\n              In Clubhouse Games for the Nintendo DS, Battleship is known as Grid Attack. It is played on an 8×8\r\n              grid, and includes slight variations, such as four-player gameplay, and various ship sizes and shapes.\r\n              Versions of Battleship appear as applications on numerous social networking services.\r\n              <br><br>\r\n              Battleship was also part of Hasbro Family Game Night for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, as well as the\r\n              Xbox 360 (Xbox Live Arcade). These alter the rules, including the size of the grid (8×12 in the NES\r\n              version, 8×8 in the Game Boy version), size of ships (it is common to feature a submarine that takes\r\n              up a single square) and special shot missiles for each ship. For example, in the NES version the\r\n              cruiser has a five-shot missile which strikes five squares in an X pattern on the grid in one turn.\r\n              Submarine-tracking sonar and aerial reconnaissance to spot ships are also features.\r\n              <br><br>\r\n              A minigame version of Battleship was used in the third season of The Hub's Family Game Night, which\r\n              uses a 5×5 grid and the first team to sink three ships wins the game.\r\n              <br><br>\r\n              In 2012, the military science fiction action movie Battleship was released, which was inspired by the\r\n              Milton Bradley board game. A version of Battleship based on the movie was released in which one side\r\n              had alien ship playing pieces.\r\n            </q-card-section>\r\n          </q-card>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"AboutTheGame.vue\"\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n<style >\r\n\r\n.bg-image{\r\n  background-image: url(\"/images/seaBackground1Wide.jpg\");\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n  background-size: cover;\r\n}\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
